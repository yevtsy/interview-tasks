/*
  There are 3 towers with N disks with different proportions.
  The goal is to transfer these disks with several limitation:
    1. It's possible to move only ONE disk per step
    2. Transfer disks only from TOP of one tower to another
    3. Disk can be put only on disk with bigger size

  So, the program should transfer disks (from first to last towers)
    based on stacks.
