    There is a simple graph oriented data structure BiNode, which contains
    links for two another nodes:

    public class BiNode {
        public BiNode node1, node2;
        public int data;
    }

    BiNode may be used to represent binary tree (node1 - left node, node2 - right one),
    or like two-direction linked list (node1 - previous node, node2 - next node).
    Make a function that transform binary search tree to two-direction linked list.
    Values must have ordered store and algorithm must run in original data structure.
